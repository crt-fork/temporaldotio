                    <p className="mt-6">Many of these jobs are not pure data manipulation programs. They also need to enrich the data and tie relevant services together. For example, processing a record may require external API calls that can fail and potentially take a long time.</p>
                    <p className="mt-6">It is common to have large data sets partitioned across many hosts or databases or have billions of files in a distributed storage. Running a myriad of data processing jobs in parallel is a hard engineering problem. You have to track to their individual statuses, schedule them on available workers, and ensuring that all the subtasks succeed.</p>

                    <p>Temporal provides hard guarantees around the durability of data and seamlessly deals with long-running operations, retries, and intermittent failures. Temporal handles the distributed nature of these systems automatically.</p>
                    <p className='mt-6'>Temporal is an ideal solution for implementing a full scan of a dataset in a scalable and resilient way. The standard pattern is to run an Activity (or multiple parallel Activities for partitioned data sets) that performs the scan and heartbeats its progress back to Temporal. In the case of a host failure, the operation is retried on a different host and continues execution from the last reported progress.</p>
                    <p className="mt-6">One crucial feature of Temporal is its ability to route task execution to a specific process or host. It is often useful to control how ML models and other large files are distributed across hosts. For example, if an ML model is partitioned by the city, the requests should be routed to hosts that contain the corresponding city model.</p>

                    <p>An application can utilize the Temporal SDK to interpret the DSL definition. This automatically makes the DSL execution highly fault-tolerant, scalable, and durable since it's running on Temporal. This means that users can migrate their existing portfolio of internal DSL-based process definitions and take advantage of Temporal as an execution engine.</p>
                    <p className="mt-6">If your company uses multiple workflow engines internally, it can be very beneficial to unify them with Temporal. For one, it is more efficient to support a single product instead of many. Additionally, it's hard to overestimate the benefit sharing Activities will bring across the company.</p>
